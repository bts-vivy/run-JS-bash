_The files in this repository are free to use, my goal is only to make it easier to run on the Pterodactyl panel, maybe it is useful for panels other than pterodactyl, I don't know that, What is clear is that this is to make it easier to be able to Bash in the console panel without having to go back and forth to startup, this is the cjs type, you can change it to esm or whatever because it is free to use and modify_
